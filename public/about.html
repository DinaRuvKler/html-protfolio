<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I am an aspiring software developer based in Northern Israel, with a
  passion for bridging the gap between design and technology. My professional
  journey began in the world of aesthetics; I hold a Practical Engineer degree
  in Architecture and Interior Design and have also specialized in User
  Experience (UX) Design.
</p>

<p>
  This unique background allows me to approach software development with a keen
  eye for detail, structure, and usability. Currently, I am fully immersed in my
  coding studies, eager to build intuitive and efficient applications that
  combine functionality with great design.
</p>

<p>
  When I am not at my computer, you will likely find me tending to my garden and
  plants, or baking fresh pastries in the kitchen.
